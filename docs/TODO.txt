Things to do now:

-Network protocol for clients when they know their ips.

-Start coding the gui

-Get a basic im client working using the now completed DHT implementation to find the ips of your friends.

-Find some good encryption libraries.

-Figure out the best way to do "lossless" UDP.

Things to do later:

-Figure out the whole sound and video transmission.

Less important.

-Symmetric NATs
    UDP hole punching on them so we need to do something else 
    (only if both the clients which try to connect to themselves are behind one)

-Offline messaging protocol (text only)
    Use your friends.(or maybe the people closest (mathematically by comparing client_id's) to you or the friend you want to send the message to).
    The message will not be very big. Let's say we limit the maximum number of bytes for one to 1024, it means if every client stores 1024 offline messages it only takes 1 MB of ram.
