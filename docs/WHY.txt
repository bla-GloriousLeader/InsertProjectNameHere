The goal of this project is to create a configuration free p2p skype 
replacement.

Configuration free means that the user will simply have to open the program and 
without any account configuration will be capable of adding people to his 
friends list and start conversing with them.

There are many so called skype replacements and all of them are either hard to 
configure for the normal user or suffer from being much too centralized.
